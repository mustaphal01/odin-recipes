    <p>Shawarma is a Middle Eastern dish made of meat (usually chicken, beef, or lamb) that is marinated, 
        then slowly roasted on a spit and shaved off into thin slices. The meat is 
        typically wrapped in a pita bread with vegetables 
        like lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers, and topped with sauces like tahini or hummus. 
        Shawarma is a popular street food in many parts of the world.</p>
